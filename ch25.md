If software architecture is worth doing, then surely it’s worth doing well. Most of the literature about architecture concentrates on the technical aspects. This is not surprising; it is a deeply technical discipline. But architectures are created by *architects* working in *organizations* that are full of actual human beings. Dealing with these humans is a decidedly nontechnical undertaking. What can be done to help architects, especially architects-in-training, be better at this important dimension of their job? And what can be done to help organizations do a better job of encouraging their architects to produce their best work?

如果软件架构值得去做，那肯定值得做好。大多数关于架构的文献都集中在技术方面。这并不奇怪，因为它是一门深奥的技术学科。但架构是由在充满真实人类的组织中工作的“架构师”创建的。与这些人打交道绝对是非技术性的工作。怎样做才能帮助架构师，尤其是正在接受培训的架构师，在工作的这一重要方面做得更好？怎样做才能帮助组织更好地鼓励其架构师做出最佳工作成果？ 

This chapter is about the competence of individual architects and the organizations that wish to produce high-quality architectures.

这一章是关于架构师个人的能力以及希望产生高质量架构的组织的。 

Since the architecture competence of an organization depends, in part, on the competence of architects, we begin by asking what it is that architects are expected to do, know, and be skilled at. Then we’ll look at what organizations can and should do to help their architects produce better architectures. Individual and organizational competencies are intertwined. Understanding only one or the other won’t do.

由于一个组织的架构能力在一定程度上取决于架构师的能力，我们首先要问的是，期望架构师做什么、知道什么以及擅长什么。然后，我们将探讨组织能够而且应该做些什么来帮助其架构师构建更好的架构。个人和组织的能力是相互交织的。只了解其中之一是不行的。 

## 25.1 Competence of Individuals: Duties, Skills, and Knowledge of Architects

## 25.1 个人能力：架构师的职责、技能和知识 

Architects perform many activities beyond directly producing an architecture. These activities, which we call *duties*, form the backbone of an individual’s architecture competence. Writers about architects also speak of *skills* and *knowledge*. For example, the ability to communicate ideas clearly and to negotiate effectively are skills often ascribed to competent architects. In addition, architects need to have up-to-date knowledge about patterns, technologies, standards, quality attributes, and a host of other topics.

架构师所从事的活动远不止直接构建架构。这些活动，我们称之为“职责”，构成了个人架构能力的主干。关于架构师的著述也会提及“技能”和“知识”。例如，清晰地传达想法和有效协商的能力，就是通常认为有能力的架构师所具备的技能。此外，架构师需要掌握关于模式、技术、标准、质量属性以及众多其他主题的最新知识。 

Duties, skills, and knowledge form a triad upon which architecture competence for individuals rests. The relationship among these three is shown in [Figure 25.1][ch25fig01]—namely, skills and knowledge support the ability to perform the required duties. Infinitely talented architects are of no use if they cannot (for whatever reason) perform the duties required of the position; we would not say they were competent.

职责、技能和知识构成了个人架构能力所依赖的一个三元组。这三者之间的关系如[图 25.1][ch25fig01]所示——即技能和知识支持履行所需职责的能力。如果（无论出于何种原因）无限有才华的架构师不能履行该职位所需的职责，那么他们是无用的；我们不会说他们是有能力的。 

![A figure shows skills and knowledge on the left and right respectively. The duties ellipse is shown at the top between the two. An arrow marks each from skills and knowledge points to the duties at the top representing the support.](ch25.assets/25fig01.jpg)

**Figure 25.1** Skills and knowledge support the execution of duties.  <a name="ch25fig01"></a>

**图25.1** 技能和知识支持履行职责。 <a name="ch25fig01"></a>

To give examples of these concepts:

为了给出这些概念的示例： 

- “Design the architecture” is a duty.
- “设计架构” 是一项职责。
- “Ability to think abstractly” is a skill.
- “抽象思考的能力” 是一项技能。
- “Patterns and tactics” constitute knowledge.
- “模式和策略” 构成知识。

These examples purposely illustrate that skills and knowledge are important (only) for supporting the ability to carry out duties effectively. As another example, “documenting the architecture” is a duty, “ability to write clearly” is a skill, and “ISO Standard 42010” is part of the related body of knowledge. Of course, a skill or knowledge area can support more than one duty.

这些示例特意说明了技能和知识对于有效履行职责的能力的支持是重要的（且仅止于此）。再举个例子，“为架构编写文档”是一项职责，“清晰写作的能力”是一项技能，“ISO 标准 42010”是相关知识体系的一部分。当然，一个技能或知识领域可以支持多项职责。 

Knowing the duties, skills, and knowledge of architects (or, more precisely, the duties, skills, and knowledge that are needed of architects in a particular organizational setting) can help establish measurement and improvement strategies for individual architects. If you want to improve your individual architectural competence, you should take the following steps:

了解架构师的职责、技能和知识（或者更确切地说，是在特定组织环境中架构师所需要的职责、技能和知识）有助于为个体架构师制定衡量和改进策略。如果您想提高个人的架构能力，应该采取以下步骤： 

1. *Gain experience carrying out the duties*. Apprenticeship is a productive path to achieving experience. Education alone is not enough, because education without on-the-job application merely enhances knowledge.
2. *积累履行职责的经验*。学徒制是获取经验的有效途径。仅仅接受教育是不够的，因为没有在职应用的教育仅仅是增加了知识。 
3. *Improve your nontechnical skills*. This dimension of improvement involves taking professional development courses, for example, in leadership or time management. Some people will never become truly great leaders or communicators, but we can all improve on these skills.
4. *提高您的非技术技能*。这方面的改进包括参加专业发展课程，例如领导力或时间管理方面的课程。有些人可能永远不会成为真正伟大的领导者或沟通者，但我们都可以在这些技能上有所提高。 
5. *Master the body of knowledge*. One of the most important things a competent architect must do is master the body of knowledge and remain up-to-date on it. To emphasize the importance of keeping current with the field, consider the advances in knowledge required for architects that have emerged in just the last few years. For example, architectures to support computing in the cloud ([Chapter 17][ch17]) were not important several years ago. Taking courses, becoming certified, reading books and journals, visiting websites, reading blogs, attending architecture-oriented conferences, joining professional societies, and meeting with other architects are all useful ways to improve knowledge.
6. *掌握知识体系*。有能力的架构师必须做的最重要的事情之一是掌握知识体系并保持其更新。为了强调跟上该领域最新进展的重要性，想想仅仅在过去几年中出现的架构师所需知识的进步。例如，几年前支持云计算的架构（[第 17 章][ch17]）并不重要。参加课程、获得认证、阅读书籍和期刊、访问网站、阅读博客、参加面向架构的会议、加入专业协会以及与其他架构师会面，都是提高知识水平的有用方法。 

### Duties

### 职责

This section summarizes a wide variety of architects’ duties. Not every architect in every organization will perform every one of these duties on every project. However, competent architects should not be surprised to find themselves engaged in any of the activities listed here. We divide these duties into technical duties ([Table 25.1][ch25tab01]) and nontechnical duties ([Table 25.2][ch25tab02]). One immediate observation you should make is the large number of many nontechnical duties. An obvious implication, for those of you who wish to be architects, is that you must pay adequate attention to the nontechnical aspects of your education and your professional activities.

本节总结了各种各样的架构师职责。并非每个组织中的每个架构师在每个项目中都会履行所有这些职责。然而，有能力的架构师如果发现自己参与到这里列出的任何活动中，都不应感到惊讶。我们将这些职责分为技术职责（[表 25.1][ch25tab01]）和非技术职责（[表 25.2][ch25tab02]）。您应该立即注意到的一点是，非技术职责的数量众多。对于那些希望成为架构师的人来说，一个明显的含义是，您必须充分关注您的教育和职业活动中的非技术方面。

Architects also routinely perform many other duties, such as leading code reviews or getting involved in test planning. In many projects, architects pitch in to help with the actual implementation and testing, in critical areas. While important, these are not strictly speaking architectural duties.

架构师通常还会履行许多其他职责，例如领导代码审查或参与测试规划。在许多项目中，架构师会在关键领域协助实际的实现和测试。虽然这些很重要，但严格来说，它们并非架构师的职责。 

### Skills

### 技能

Given the wide range of duties enumerated in the previous section, which skills does an architect need to possess? Much has been written about the architect’s special role of leadership in a project; the ideal architect is an effective communicator, manager, team builder, visionary, and mentor. Some certificate or certification programs emphasize nontechnical skills. Common to these certification programs are assessment areas of leadership, organization dynamics, and communication.

鉴于上一节中列举的广泛职责，架构师需要具备哪些技能？关于架构师在项目中的特殊领导角色，已经有很多论述；理想的架构师是有效的沟通者、管理者、团队建设者、有远见者和导师。一些证书或认证项目强调非技术技能。这些认证项目的常见评估领域包括领导力、组织动态和沟通。 

[Table 25.3][ch25tab03] enumerates the set of skills most useful to an architect.

### What about Experience?

### 那经验方面呢？  

Albert Einstein said, “The only source of knowledge is experience,” and just about everybody says that experience is the best teacher. We agree. However, experience is not the *only* teacher—you can also acquire knowledge from *real* teachers. How lucky we are that we need not all burn ourselves to acquire the knowledge that touching a hot stove is a bad idea.

阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦说过：“知识的唯一来源是经验。” 几乎每个人都说经验是最好的老师。我们同意。然而，经验并非唯一的老师——你也可以从真正的老师那里获取知识。我们多么幸运，不必都通过烫伤自己来获得“触摸热炉子不是个好主意”这一知识。 

We consider experience as something that adds to an architect’s store of knowledge, which is why we don’t treat it separately. As your career advances, you’ll accumulate your own wealth of experience, which you’ll store as knowledge.

我们将经验视为能增加架构师知识储备的东西，这就是为什么我们不单独对待它。随着您职业生涯的发展，您将积累自己丰富的经验，并将其作为知识存储起来。 

As the old joke goes, a pedestrian in New York stopped a passerby and asked, “Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?” The passerby, who happened to be a musician, replied with a heavy sigh, “Practice, practice, practice.”

正如那个老笑话所说，在纽约，一位行人拦住一位路人问道：“不好意思。您能告诉我怎么去卡内基音乐厅吗？”碰巧是音乐家的这位路人长叹一口气回答道：“练习，练习，练习。” 

Exactly.

的确如此。

## 25.2 Competence of a Software Architecture Organization

## 25.2 软件架构组织的能力

Organizations, by their practices and structure, can either help or hinder architects in performing their duties. For example, if an organization has a career path for architects, that will motivate employees to become architects. If an organization has a standing architecture review board, then the project architect will know how and with whom to schedule a review. The absence of these practices and structures will mean that an architect has to fight battles with the organization or determine how to carry out a review without internal guidance. It makes sense, therefore, to ask whether a particular organization is architecturally competent and to develop instruments whose goal is measuring the architectural competence of an organization. The architectural competence of organizations is the topic of this section. Here is our definition:

组织通过其实践和结构，推动或者是阻碍架构师履行职责。例如，如果一个组织为架构师设有职业发展路径，这将激励员工成为架构师。如果一个组织设有常设的架构审查委员会，那么项目架构师将知道如何以及与谁安排审查。如果没有这些实践和结构，这意味着架构师必须与组织斗争，或者在没有内部指导的情况下确定如何进行审查。因此，询问特定组织在架构方面是否有能力，并开发旨在衡量组织架构能力的工具是有意义的。组织的架构能力是本节的主题。以下是我们的定义： 

The architectural competence of an organization is the ability of that organization to grow, use, and sustain the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively carry out architecture-centric practices at the individual, team, and organizational levels to produce architectures with acceptable cost that lead to systems aligned with the organization’s business goals.

一个组织的架构能力是指该组织在个人、团队和组织层面上培养、运用和维持有效开展以架构为中心的实践所需的技能和知识的能力，以产生成本可接受的架构，从而形成与组织业务目标相一致的系统。 

Organizations have duties, skills, and knowledge for architecture, just like individual architects. For example, adequately funding the architecture effort is an organizational duty, as is effectively using the available architecture workforce (by appropriate teaming and other means). These are organizational duties because they are outside the control of individual architects. An organization-level skill might be effective knowledge management or human resource management as applied to architects. An example of organizational knowledge is the composition of an architecture-based life-cycle model that software projects may employ.

组织对于架构有职责、技能和知识，就像个体架构师一样。例如，为架构工作提供充足的资金是一项组织职责，有效地利用现有的架构人力（通过适当的团队组建和其他方式）也是如此。这些是组织职责，因为它们不受个体架构师的控制。组织层面的技能可能是应用于架构师的有效的知识管理或人力资源管理。组织的知识的一个例子是软件项目可能采用的基于架构的生命周期模型的构成。 

Here are some things—duties—that an organization could perform to help improve the success of its architecture efforts:

如果您正在一个组织中面试架构师的职位，您可能会有一系列问题来决定是否愿意在那里工作。对于那个问题清单，您可以添加从前面的列表中提取的问题，以帮助您确定该组织的架构能力水平。 

## 25.3 Become a Better Architect

## 25.3 成为更优秀的架构师

How do architects become good architects, and how do good architects become great architects? We close this chapter with a proposal, which is this: Be mentored, and mentor others.

架构师如何成为优秀的架构师，优秀的架构师又如何成为杰出的架构师？在本章的结尾，我们提出一个建议，那就是：接受指导，并指导他人。 

### Be Mentored

### 接受指导

While experience may be the best teacher, most of us will not have the luxury, in a single lifetime, to gain firsthand all the experience needed to make us great architects. But we can gain experience secondhand. Find a skilled architect whom you respect, and attach yourself to that person. Find out if your organization has a mentoring program that you can join. Or establish an informal mentoring relationship—find excuses to interact, ask questions, or offer to help (for instance, offer to be a reviewer).

虽然经验可能是最好的老师，但在一生中，我们大多数人都没有足够的幸运能够亲自获得使我们成为杰出建筑师所需的所有经验。但我们可以间接获取经验。找一位您尊敬的熟练建筑师，并与他/她建立联系。了解您所在的组织是否有您可以参加的指导计划。或者建立一种非正式的指导关系——找借口互动、提问或主动提供帮助（例如，主动提出担任评审员）。 

Your mentor doesn’t have to be a colleague. You can also join professional societies where you can establish mentor relationships with other members. There are meetups. There are professional social networks. Don’t limit yourself to just your organization.

您的导师不一定非得是同事。您还可以加入专业社团，在那里您可以与其他成员建立导师关系。有聚会。有专业的社交网络。不要把自己局限于所在的组织。 

### Mentor Others

### 指导他人

You should also be willing to mentor others as a way of giving back or paying forward the kindnesses that have enriched your career. But there is a selfish reason to mentor as well: We find that teaching a concept is the litmus test of whether we deeply understand that concept. If we can’t teach it, it’s likely we don’t really understand it—so that can be part of your goal in teaching and mentoring others in the profession. Good teachers almost always report their delight in how much they learn from their students, and how much their students’ probing questions and surprising insights add to the teachers’ deeper understanding of the subject.

你也应该愿意指导他人，以此作为回报或传递那些丰富了你职业生涯的善意的一种方式。但指导他人也有一个自私的原因：我们发现，教授一个概念是检验我们是否深刻理解该概念的试金石。如果我们无法教授它，很可能我们并没有真正理解它——所以这可以成为你在该行业中教导和指导他人的目标的一部分。优秀的教师几乎总是会表示他们很高兴能从学生身上学到很多，以及学生的探索性问题和令人惊讶的见解如何加深了教师对该学科的更深入理解。 

## 25.4 Summary

## 25.4 小结

When we think of software architects, we usually first think of the technical work that they produce. But, in the same way that an architecture is much more than a technical “blueprint” for a system, an architect is much more than a designer of an architecture. This has led us to try to understand, in a more holistic way, what an architect and an architecture-centric organization must do to succeed. An architect must carry out the duties, hone the skills, and continuously acquire the knowledge necessary to be successful.

当我们想到软件架构师时，通常首先想到的是他们所产出的技术工作。但是，正如架构远不止是系统的技术“蓝图”一样，架构师也远不止是架构的设计者。这促使我们以更全面的方式去理解，架构师和以架构为中心的组织要想成功必须做些什么。架构师必须履行职责、磨炼技能，并持续获取成功所需的知识。 

The key to becoming a good and then a better architect is continuous learning, mentoring, and being mentored.

成为一名优秀乃至更出色的架构师的关键在于持续学习、指导他人以及接受他人的指导。
